A measurement system has to be devised such that the relationship between the real value of a variable and the value actually measured is unambiguously known. For example, when placing a weight on a scale, we must know the relationship between the \textbf{true} weight and the \textbf{measured} weight.

\end{figure}
The measurement system must allow:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Easy interpretation of the measured data
  \item Provide high degree of confidence
\end{itemize}

\section{Transducers}
A transducer converts the sensed variable into a detectable signal form. Sometimes the device changes a mechanical quantity into a change in an  electrical quantity. For example, a strain gauge converts a change in strain in the specimen to a change in electrical resistance in the gauge. Another example is a thermometer which converts thermal expansion of the liquid (due to a rise in temperature) into a mechanical translation.
\section{Signal condition circuits}
This takes the transducer signal and can convert, compensate or manipulate it into a more usable electrical quantity. This may include filters, compensators, modulators, demodulators, integrators or differentiators. For example, a Wheatstone bridge used with the strain gauge converts the change in the electrical resistance of the gauge to a change in voltage.
\section{Amplifiers}
They are required in systems when the output from the transducer-signal conditions is small. Gains of 10 - 1000 are used to increase the levels of the signal, typically a millivolt or less, to what is compatible with the voltage-measuring devices used in the system. A negative-feedback amplifier circuit is an example of an amplifier.
\section{Output stage}
Generally, it is a voltage measurement device that is used to display the measurement in a form that can be read and interpreted. For example, digital voltmeters, self-balancing potentiometers, oscilloscopes, chart recorders and magnetic tape recorders.
\section{Feedback-control stage}
Used when the measurement system is employed in process control. The signal from the measurement system is compared with the command signal that reflects the required value of the quantity in the process. The process-controller forms the difference between these two and produces and error signal. The error signal is then used to automatically adjust the process. For example, the float system in a toilet (called a ballock) to control the water supply in the tank.
